!In this appendix we give a complete program in C for our algorithm for site percolation on a square lattice of N = L × L sites with periodic boundary conditions. This program prints out the size of the largest cluster on the lattice as a function of number of occupied sites n for values of n from 1 to N . The entire program consists of 73 lines of code. First we set up some constants and global variables:
!Below is a simple translation of the functions in fortran

!Site percolation can be handled by only a very slight modification of the algorithm. In this case, sites are occupied in random
!order on the lattice, and each site occupied is declared to be a new cluster of size 1. Then one adds, one by one, all bonds between this site and the occupied sites, if any, adjacent to it, using the algorithm described above.-> how?

! This program contains some additional lines that let you compute the size of the largest non-percolating cluster and the susceptibility
